/**
 * <p>This demo computes a stream of values and feeds them first to
 * an exact sort-based method of computing the number of unique values
 * in the stream and then feeds a similar stream to two different types of
 * sketches from the library.
 * 
 * <p>This demo becomes most significant in the case where the number of uniques in the 
 * stream exceeds what the computer can hold in memory.
 * 
 * <p>This demo utilizes the Unix/Linux/OS-X sort and wc commands for the brute force compuation.
 * So this needs to be run on a linux or mac machine. A windows machine with a suitable unix
 * library installed might also work, but it has not been tested.
 * 
 * <p>To run this demo from the command line:</p>
 * <ul><li>Clone the lastest snapshot from https://github.com/DataSketches/sketches-core.</li>
 * <li>Change to the directory where you did the clone</li>
 * <li>Do a Maven Install: "mvn install"</li>
 * <li>In the following commands replace X.Y.Z with the actual jar version from the target 
 * directory:<br>
 * javac -cp target/sketches-core-X.Y.Z.jar  src/test/java/com/yahoo/sketches/demo/*.java<br>
 * java -cp target/sketches-core-X.Y.Z.jar:src/test/java com.yahoo.sketches.demo.ExactVsSketchDemo 
 * 1E6</li>
 * <li>The demo will output results to the console.  You can change the 1E6 (1 million) to even 
 * larger values (e.g., 1E8) but be patient.  The exact sort can take a long, long time!</li>
 * </ul>
 *
